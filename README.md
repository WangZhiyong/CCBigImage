CCBigImage 
==================

CCBigImage is Node for Cocos2d-x. You are able to view a big image.
It just loads/unloads tiles dynamically in other thread, keeping in memory only tiles that user can see right now.

I was ported CCBigImage in cocos2d-extensions/CCBigImage to Cocos2d-x(C++).
cocos2d-extensions is available here: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone-extensions

* Tile-Cutter is inlcuded as compiled commandLine tool in prepareResoures folder. Source code of Tile-Cutter is available here: https://github.com/psineur/Tile-Cutter
